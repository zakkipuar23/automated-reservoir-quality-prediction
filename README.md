# Schlumberger Hackathon
### As a geophysical engineering graduate, bringing together the challenges of geoscience work with machine learning solutions, is an interesting task! The challenges in petroleum industry and this hackathon brief explanation is written in pdf file named "Onboarding Webinar Slide"

I upload my team submission in pdf file named "Magnitude_Geoscience" to this repository. Our project title is "**Automated Reservoir Quality Prediction using Multi Feature Geoscience Data**".
The submission consist : 
- problem statement whose solution we try to find
- the explanation of our technical solution (including list of tech stack needed, the solution architecture and mockup of final report), 
- the novelty of result from our proposed idea
